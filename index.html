                        I can speak 2 languages currently, Persian or Farsi as my
                        native language and English is something that i picked on since i was kid, also I've
                        been working on my third language Japanese.

                    Ever since i played my first online game i realized how much
                    i love a good challenge, how it feels to be the best at something 
                    but it had come with a price of dedication, so for me it was a 
                    win win.

                Since i was a kid i have been a gamer, It was fascinating to me how you could 
                do things that you couldnt just simply do in real life, eaither it needed alot of
                money or skills or it didnt exist at all, so i decided that i to ignore the
                last part and change the things that i could and be that someone that 
                i would look up to.
